# instagram_clone
Personal Project

This project is basically cloning simple database that instagram might have with only couple of tables that I created as well as the data itself. 

*insta_clone_tables
This file creates the baseline of the database. The codes include creating a new schema first, then creates 7 different tables such as
1. users
2. photos
3. comments
4. likes
5. follows
6. tags
7. photo_tags

*insta_clone_inserts
This file simply inserts random datasets that I created into different tables.

*insta_clone_exec_statements
Translate real world scenarios into SQL statements to get the result for data analysis. The comments line in this file are some of the questions
that could be asked from the client or the company, and the SQL codes that I executed can pull of those important information from the database.
